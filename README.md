# neuralNetworks
This project comprises a series of experiments where build, analyze, and monitor neural networks. Moreover, we also explore an interpretability technique that I invented. That is, we build a neural network interpreter by fine-tuning Mistral7b &amp; Mixtral8x7b to interpret a target neural network in an automated way.
